Explain the performance and use-case differences between RSA and AES:


RSA:

Asymmetric encryption (uses key pair);

Slower - best for encrypting small data or keys;

Used in TLS handshakes and digital signatures.


AES

Symmetric encryption (same key for encrypt/decrypt);

Much faster - ideal for large files;

Commonly used for bulk data encryption.
